# Pec-Man
Pec-Man is a game that is pretty much a carbon copy of pac-man, except with a bodybuilder theme.
The goal of the game is to get as much gains as possible. Gains are gotten by collecting benches and weights. Gains are lost when Pec-Man runs into a treadmill, because cardio will steal all your gains. When Pec-Man collects Protein Whey, he temporarily becomes strong enough to dismantle treadmills. The pure strength assosiated with tearing up treadmills gives him more gains.
